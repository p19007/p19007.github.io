        <center><h2> What are vaccines? </h2></center>
        <center><p> Vaccines are normally injections, although they can also be delivered orally or by nose spray, which are designed to protect you from a particular virus, bacteria or toxin (also known as pathogen) by training your immune system. They are important as they stop you getting ill from the disease and the complications that may arise from that. </p></center>

      <div id="what2">
        <center><h2> How do they work? </h2></center>
        <center><p> Vaccines contain either weakened or dead forms of the pathogen which poses no danger to you. It does, however, cause a response from your immune system. This familiarises your immune system with the pathogen, creating what are called <i>memory cells</i>, and means it will respond faster next time it encounters the pathogen. Therefore, you will not get ill. </p></center>
