    <p> Over the years, since vaccines become widespread due to Edward Jenner's discovery of a smallpox vaccine in 1796, there have been many myths about the supposed side-effects or dangers of having particular vaccinations. These have been made more dangerous in recent years as they are spread on social media, so more people have access to, and believe, this fake news and refuse to have important vaccinations - endangering themselves and others. </p>

    <p> Here are some of the most famous ones, and a little of how they came into circulation. They are not all of them, by any means, and if you should hear a worrying rumour about a particular vaccination, be sure to consult your doctor or look on the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/">NHS website</a>.</p>

            <h2>Myth 1: Vaccines contain unsafe toxins</h2>
            <p>The contents of vaccines are a subject that those seeking to spread fake news about vaccines often use. However, there is no reason to worry about the safety of vaccines as they have all been through extensive trialling and tests.</p>

            <p>Vaccines contain dead or weakened forms of the bacteria, virus or toxin they protect against. These are not dangerous and cannot give you the disease that you are being vaccinated against as they have been killed or weakened in a laboratory first. </p>

            <p>Vaccines also contain other substances such as aluminium or egg protein. These are in the vaccine for different reasons. For example, small amounts of aluminium helps your body build stronger immunity to the vaccine so it can better protect you. Egg protein is a result of the vaccine being grown on eggs (normally chicken) and has been proved to not be dangerous, even to those who normally have an anaphylactic reaction to egg.</p>

            <p>There is a list of other ingredients used in vaccinations and why they are not dangerous on the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/why-vaccination-is-safe-and-important/">NHS website</a> which can reassure you that the ingredients of vaccinations are perfectly safe.</p>

            <h2>Myth 3: Herd immunity is enough protection</h2>
            <p>This is a common misconception rather than the result of deliberate fake news.</p>
            
            <p>The important thing to remember is that the unvaccinated minority is only protected by herd immunity if <b>greater than 90%</b>of a population is vaccinated.</p>

            <p>There are people who cannot have vaccines for many reasons including poor immune systems or severe allergic reactions to specific substances. Therefore, to protect them, everybody who <i>can</i> have the vaccine should do, to try and eradicate the disease altogether. This is what happened with smallpox and so now no-one needs the smallpox vaccination as it no longer exists.</p>

            <p>You can find out more about how herd immunity works on the <a href="https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/herd-immunity">Oxford Vaccine Group </a>website or discover more about the smallpox eradication on the <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/smallpox#tab=tab_1">World Health Organisation (WHO)</a> website.</p>

              <h2>Myth 2: Vaccines cause/increase the risk of autism</h2>
              <p>This is possibly the biggest myth about vaccinations that has ever been spread and sadly still affects people to this day.</p>

              <p> The fear that vaccines increase the risk of autism started in 1997 when a British surgeon named Andrew Wakefield published a study in <i>The Lancet</i> - a prestigious medical journal which suggested that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine was increasing the occurence of autism in British children. </p>

              <p>In May 2010, the paper was fully retracted by <i>The Lancet</i> and Wakefield was struck off the medical register following a General Medical Council (GMC) investigation in which he was charged with dishonesty, conflict of interest and abuse of the developmentally challenged children in his study. It was later found that Wakefield had deliberately manipulated the results of his study and misreported them to lead readers to the conclusion he wanted.</p>

              <p>Several other major studies have been conducted and no link has been found between any vaccine and the likelihood of developing autism. In fact, recent research suggests that autism develops in the utero, well before a baby is even born. </p>

              <p>You can find more information on the MMR vaccination on the <a href="https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/mmr-vaccine">Oxford Vaccine Group</a> website including a list of all the studies disproving any link between MMR and autism.</p>

            <h2>Myth 4: Vaccines aren't worth the risk</h2>
            <p>This is a frequent concern which utterly falls apart if you look at the statistics.</p>

            <p>For example, the chances of having an anaphylactic (very severe) allergic reaction to any vaccination is around 1 in 1,000,000 doses.</p>
            
            <p>However, the risks of complications from getting the disease are much worse. Around 1 in 15 children will develop more serious complications from measles. These can range from ear infections (affecting 1 in 12 people) to encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) which affects 1 in every 1000-2000 measles cases and can lead to permanent brain damage or death. There can also be more severe consequences such as SSPE. Find out more about SSPE <a href="https://youtu.be/aB8kGwKZiq0">here</a>.</p>
